# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Used started code from github provided by the bootcamp
The calendar diplays time blocks for normal working hour (9am-5pm)
Each time block is color coded based on if it is present, in the past or in the future
When the user adds and activity for an hour and saves it, it is saved local storage and displayed when the calendar is refreshed
